# D3 Sandbox
This project exists to explore and learn the latest version of D3 ^7. To prove concepts before incorporating them into SnapAttack.

There is currently one basic implementation of a tree layout, `BasicTree.tsx`. The styling is off but the basics of loading and easily changing styling is in place.

## Install
```bash
yarn
```

## Setup
create a `.env` file from the example and add your credentials

## Start
```bash
yarn dev
```

## Observe
Navigate to `localhost:3000` Then  
Click `login` and then `View Basic Tree`
